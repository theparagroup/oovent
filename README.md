# oovent
The Oovent event management system.

You need to clone the "paralib-net" repo to be cloned along side this repo.
	
It should look like this:

	wherever
		paralib-net
			packages
			paralib-dal
			.
			.
			.
			
		oovent
			packages
			oovent-mvc
			.
			.
			.
			
And you need to ensure all NuGet packages exist for both solutions.
